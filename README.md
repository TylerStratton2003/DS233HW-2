getWeather.py will take in three parameters:
  1) The column name for the CSV file - use "Col_Name" format
  2) The keyword to access a specific piece of the weather data - examples include "windSpeed" and "windGust"
  3) the CSV filename - use "filename.csv" format

If the run command is not of this format, it will not create a CSV file:
  python getWeather.py Col_Name windSpeed filename.csv

Once the CSV file is successfully, created, it will print a success statement to the terminal.
